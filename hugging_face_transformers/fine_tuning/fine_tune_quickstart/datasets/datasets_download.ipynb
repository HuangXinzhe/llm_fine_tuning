Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.\"}"

We arrived at just before noon.  It was not that busy and it never really got overly busy for what I  would expect would be a busy lunch rush.  Ok so we were a party of 8 at lunch time but we didn't order anything out of the ordinary, some quesadillas, a couple of burgers a few sandwiches and some salads.  We were so famished by the time we got our meals we ate quickly. Also by the time we got our checks and they processed the cards that was another PROOOOOOCESSS.\\nWe had an hour for lunch and we were more than 15 min late to our meeting next door at Bass Pro. I have been to other places like Chili's for lunch and I have been in and out within about 45 min.  \\n\\nIf you are not in a hurry and in the area consider them but there is plenty of other places to consider near by.</td>\n",

No robes, a balcony you can't access unless you are an owner (apparently it's a condo-hotel), small kitchenette with everything you might need except a working dishwasher (and no regular dish detergent to do the dishes by hand). Pool area is pretty small with very little shade -- we spent most days at the Palms pool. While at the Palms you might feel like you are \\\"in the middle of it\\\", we definitely felt \\\"off-strip\\\" at Palms Place -- not a good thing for a bachelorette group.
